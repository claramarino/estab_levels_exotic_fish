# Exotic species traits across levels of establishment
---

Scripts and data for reproducing the results obtained by Bernery, Marino & Bellard (2023) in the paper "Relative importance of exotic species traits in determining invasiveness across levels of establishment: Example of freshwater fish"

## Description of the Data and file structure

### 1. Traits and establishment groups of exotic fish

Data file 00_Traits_alien_iast_birds.rds contains the taxonomy, the traits and the impact information of the 850 bird species involved in biological invasions (864 lines x 21 columns).
Lines refer to species (note that 14 species are duplicated because they are in both alien and IAS-threatened groups).

Column description:
- binomial (factor): binomial name of species as in IUCN Red List
- Ecosystem (binary): impact mechanism includes habitat/ecosystem modification (1) or not (0)
- Direct_sp_effect (binary): impact mechanism includes a direct effect on species (1) or not (0)
- Indirect_sp_effect (binary): impact mechanism includes an indirect effect on species (1) or not (0)
- combi (factor): combination of the three impact mechanisms (columns "Ecosystem", "Direct_sp_effect" and "Indirect_sp_effect" pasted together)
- group (factor): species is alien ("EICAT") or IAS-threatened ("IAS-T")
- group2 (factor): species is alien with high impact ("EICAT_imp"), alien with low impact ("EICAT_no_imp"), alien with no information on impact ("EICAT_DD"), IAS-threatened with high impact ("IAS-T_imp") or IAS-threatened with low impact ("IAS-T_no_imp")
- Species1 (factor): binomial name of species as in AVONET
- Hand.Wing.Index (numeric): Hand-wing index (ratio, no unit)
- Tail.Length (numeric): length of the tail (mm)
- hab_sum (numeric): number of different habitats used
- insular_endemic (binary): species is insular endemic (1) or not (0)
- volant (binary): species has the ability to fly (1) or not(0)
- Trophic.Level (factor): trophic level
- Primary.Lifestyle (factor): preferential foraging niche
- ln.Mass (numeric): log-transformed body mass (gram)
- ln.Clutch (numeric): log-transformed clutch size (number of eggs)
- ln.Beak.Depth (numeric): log-transformed beak depth (mm)
- ln.Beak.Length_Nares (numeric): log-transformed beak length (mm)
- bioreg (factor): bioregion of origin 
- insul_level (numeric): species is mainland endemic (1), present on mainland and islands (2), insular endemic (3)


### 2. Traits of worldwide birds

Data file 00_Traits_worldwide_birds.rds contains the taxonomy and the traits of all worldwide birds (10 943 lines x 13 columns).
Lines refer to species.

Column description:
- binomial (character): binomial name of species as in IUCN Red List
- Beak.Depth (numeric): beak depth (mm)
- Hand.Wing.Index (numeric): Hand-wing index (ratio, no unit)
- Tail.Length (numeric): length of the tail (mm)
- Mass (numeric): body mass (gram)
- hab_sum (numeric): number of different habitats used
- Clutch (numeric): clutch size (number of eggs)
- Beak.Length_Nares (numeric): beak length (mm)
- Trophic.Level (character): trophic level
- Primary.Lifestyle (character): preferential foraging niche
- bioreg (factor): bioregion of origin 
- insul_level (numeric): species is mainland endemic (1), present on mainland and islands (2), insular endemic (3)

### How to use the scripts

The first script computes the axes of the multidimensionnal functional space based on the traits of both alien and IAS-threatened birds. The second script performs the statistical analyses based on the functional space and creates the figures 1 and 4. The third script performs the trait-by-trait analysis and creates the figured 2 and 3. The last script describes the steps implemented for evaluating the prediction of impact type based on the position of birds in the functional space.
